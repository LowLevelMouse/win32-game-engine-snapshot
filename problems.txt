Collision Detection Problem AABB (Axis Aligned Bounding Box)

void PopulateWorld(entity* Entities, int* EntityCount)
{
	float Width = 400;
	float Height = 200;
	float PadX = 300;
	float PadY = 150;
	
	float XStart =  Width + 100;
	float X = XStart;
	float Y = 0;
	
	for(int EntityY = 0; EntityY < 10; EntityY++)
	{
		X = XStart;
		for(int EntityX = 0; EntityX < 10; EntityX++)
		{
			AddEntity(Entities, EntityCount, X, Y, Width, Height);
			
			X+= Width + PadX;
		}
		
		Y+= Height + PadY;
	}
}


We have a grid of rectangles which the distance between are too big for the player rectangle to get in between.
Player Rectangle can get "stuck" right on a corner when grinding because it's redirecting the wrong axis, 
putting an infinite loop of user pushes in, collision pushes the wrong axis back out, so you freeze and cant make any progress. Example grinding from below pushing up and left, freezes on a corner in the "left" rectangle if we
are grinding into two rectanlges from the bottom. The left rectangle in this case is also earlier in the entity list
which may also be causing the issue, if it collided with the right rectangle first it would work fine but that may 
be too uncertain.

Resolving one axis at a time solves this issue
